# angular-slugify

Provides “slugification” for AngularJS in the form of a service, filter, and
a directive.

## What is a slug?

A slug is that final portion of a URL which is derived from some other piece of
information, usually the title of a page.

For example, “Man Bites Dog” might produce the slug `man-bites-dog` for the URL:

`http://example.com/2013/04/man-bites-dog.html`

## Installation

### Bower
```bash
$ bower install angular-slugify
```

## Usage

Include `angular-slugify.js` in your HTML document somewhere after you have set
up AngularJS.

Make `slugifier` a dependency in your AngularJS app.

```js
angular.module("myApp", ["slugifier"]);
```

### Service

The `Slug` service provides a single function `slugify` that takes a string
input as argument and returns the slugified string.

```js
function MyCtrl($scope, Slug) {
    $scope.slugify = function(input) {
        $scope.mySlug = Slug.slugify(input);
    };
}
```

### Filter

The `slugify` filter slugifies any text passed to it in an AngularJS curly-brace
expression.

```html
<input type="text" ng-model="title">
<p>Slug: {{title | slugify}}</p>
```

### Directive

The `slug` directive is a way to declaratively say one model is the
slugification of another.

```html
<slug from="post.title" to="post.slug">My slug is {{post.slug}}</slug>
<p>It also works out here: {{post.slug}}</p>
```

The `from` attribute is the name of the model in the current scope you want to
slugify. The `to` attribute is the name of the model you want to be
automatically updated with the slugification whenever `from` changes.

## Tests

```bash
$ grunt test:dist
$ grunt test:dev
